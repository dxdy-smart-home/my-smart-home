### Firmware

- CC2531-router.hex – just a router, without diagnostics and a USB serial port.
- CC2531-router-diag.hex – a router with diagnostic reports and without a USB serial port.
- CC2531-router-diag-usb.hex – a router with diagnostic reports and a USB serial port. The firmware dumps diagnostic reports to the serial port too.

### Buttons

SW1 – Changes a virtual state of the router (the router sends it in a diagnostic report) and a state of the green light.

SW2:

- Short single press – to re-send a binding request to a coordinator (it allows you to test a connection).
- Long single press (about 5 seconds) – to reset the router and initiate a joining process.

### Lights:

Green light – a short blink when the router connected to a network.

Red light:

- short fast blinks (one per second) – the router is connecting to a network.
- long blinks (one short flash per 4 seconds) – normal operations.
- three short blinks – the router cannot send a report to a coordinator.
